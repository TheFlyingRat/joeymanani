                <h4>// Welcome</h4>
                <p>Hi there - I'm glad you stopped by. You've landed on the personal site of a software developer who's passionate about building technology that solves real problems. Whether you're here out of curiosity or you're exploring what developers actually do, you're in the right place.</p>

                <h4>// What is Software Development?</h4>
                <p>Think of software development as crafting solutions with logic and creativity. Much like following a recipe, we take a set of requirements, combine them with the right tools, programming languages, frameworks and design patterns, and build applications that people can use and benefit from.</p>

                <h4>// What Do Developers Actually Do?</h4>
                <p>On a typical day, we write code, test it, break it, fix it, and improve it. It's a constant cycle of refining ideas and making things better. We work closely with other developers, designers, and project managers to turn concepts into working software. When bugs appear, we troubleshoot them methodically: part logic, part instinct, and yes, part coffee.</p>

            <section id="cybersecurity">
                <h4>// Where Does Cybersecurity Fit In?</h4>
                <p>As developers, it's not enough to make things work. We also need to make sure they're secure. Cybersecurity is about protecting systems, data and users from digital threats. It touches every part of software development, from how we handle passwords to how we defend against malicious attacks.</p>
                <p>I've developed a strong interest in this area because the digital world depends on trust. Writing secure code, understanding vulnerabilities, and thinking like both a builder and a breaker. It's all part of building technology that people and businesses can rely on.</p>
                <p>Security isn't just an afterthought — it's a mindset. And in a world where cyber threats are more sophisticated than ever, it's never been more important.</p>

                <h4>// Why Software Development?</h4>
                <p>For me, it's the perfect blend of challenge and creativity. Technology evolves rapidly, which means there's always something new to learn. That keeps things exciting and fresh.</p>
                <p>It's also deeply rewarding. Writing code that helps others, automates a tedious task, or powers a next big idea, that's the part I love most. Add to that a thriving job market and strong career prospects, and it's easy to see why so many of us are drawn to this field.</p>

                <h4>// Getting Started</h4>
                <p>If you're curious about coding or considering a path in tech, I encourage you to explore it. There's an incredible community out there and countless resources to help you begin. A great place to start is <a href="https://tfrs.link/free-code-camp" target="_blank">freeCodeCamp</a>, which offers hands-on, beginner-friendly material.</p>
                <p>I also write a blog where I share what I'm working on and what I'm learning along the way. You can visit it <a href="https://blog.joeymanani.com" target="_blank">here</a></p>
                <p>Additionally, if you just want to chat or want some advice, consider contacting me via email <a href="mailto:contact@joeymanani.com">here</a></p>
