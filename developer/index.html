                <h4>// Welcome</h4>
                <p>Thank you for visiting. This site is where I share my work, my interests and the thinking behind the projects I build. If you are exploring my portfolio or simply curious about the world of software development, you are in the right place.</p>

            <section id="what-is-software-dev">
                <h4>// What is Software Development?</h4>
                <p>Software development is the practice of creating digital solutions through logic, structure and creativity. It begins with understanding a need, choosing the tools that best support the idea, and shaping everything into a working system. At its heart, it is a craft that blends problem solving with thoughtful design.</p>

            <section id="what-devs-do">
                <h4>// What Do Developers Actually Do?</h4>
                <p>A large part of the work involves writing code and shaping it into something reliable. We test ideas, adjust them, revisit them and keep refining the result until it feels right. Collaboration is a big part of the process as well. Developers work closely with designers, engineers and other teams to bring concepts from early discussions into real, functioning software. When issues appear, we investigate, trace the cause, and work methodically until everything is back on track.</p>

            <section id="cybersecurity">
                <h4>// Where Does Cybersecurity Fit In?</h4>
                <p>Modern software has to be dependable, and that includes keeping users and data safe. Cybersecurity shapes the choices we make long before a project is finished. It influences how we handle information, how we design systems and how we prepare for the unexpected. A strong understanding of security allows us to build with confidence and anticipate risks before they cause harm.</p>
                <p>This area is something I deeply care about. Learning how vulnerabilities work, how attackers think, and how to strengthen systems has become an important part of my approach to building software.</p>
                <p>Good security is not an afterthought. It belongs in every stage of development.</p>

                <h4>// Why Software Development?</h4>
                <p>I chose this field because it constantly challenges me and gives me room to grow. Technology changes quickly and that creates opportunities to learn something new all the time. I enjoy the process of turning ideas into something that works great and meets peoples' need.</p>
                <p>There is also a sense of purpose in creating tools that help people. Whether the impact is small or large, contributing to something useful and meaningful is what I value most about this career.</p>
