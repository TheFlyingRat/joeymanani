            </div>
            <p>Hello! I'm Joey Manani, a 19-year-old software developer and cybersecurity enthusiast with a passion for technology, creativity, and constant learning.</p>

            <p>I specialise in <a href="/developer">software development and cybersecurity</a>, and I'm always exploring new technologies, tools, and ideas. Whether I'm building full-stack apps or diving deep into system security, I love solving problems that matter and learning something new every step of the way.</p>
            
            <p>Outside of tech, I enjoy video games, photography, content creation, exploring, table tennis, and solving puzzles. I'm also a big fan of great food and love discovering new restaurants and cuisines, especially when shared with friends.</p>
            
            <p>While I definitely wear the 'nerd' badge proudly, I keep up with the latest trends in AI, cybersecurity, and software engineering. I also have a creative side. I enjoy blending design thinking into my work, and I find visual storytelling through photography just as satisfying as clean, elegant code.</p>
            
            <p>I believe in making the most of every opportunity, taking smart risks, and doing things that push me forward, whether it's a new project, a side hustle, or something completely out of my comfort zone.</p>
            
            <p>If you want to talk tech, collaborate, or just say hi, feel free to <a href="mailto:contact@joeymanani.com">drop me an email</a>.</p>
            
            <p>Prefer encrypted comms? You can grab my public PGP key <a href="https://cdn.theflyingrat.com/assets/files/public.asc" rel="noopener noreferrer">here</a>.</p>
