            <p>Hey, my name is Joey Manani, and I'm a 17-year-old with a love for technology.</p>

            <p>I'm a <a href="/developer">software developer</a> and I'm constantly learning and exploring new things.</p>
            
            <p>When I'm not coding away on my computer, I enjoy playing video games, hanging out with friends, and learning new things. I enjoy playing table tennis and love solving puzzles. I'm also a foodie and love trying new restaurants and cuisines.</p>
            
            <p>I'm a bit of a nerd, hence I love to learn about new technologies and keep up with the latest advancements in the tech world. But, I also have a little creative side and love to express myself through design and photography.</p>
            
            <p>I believe in living life to the fullest and making the most of every opportunity that comes my way. I'm not afraid to take risks and try new things, and I believe that life is too short to play everything too safe.</p>
            
            <p>In conclusion, I'm a fun-loving, tech-savvy, and adventurous 17-year-old who's always up for a good time. So, if you're looking for someone to share a laugh with or talk tech, then <a href="mailto:theflyingrat@theflyingrat.com">I'm your guy!</a></p>
            
            <p>Or, if you prefer E2EE, you can contact me on <a href="mailto:joeymanani@skiff.com">Skiff.</a></p>
