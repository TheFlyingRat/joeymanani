            <p>As a software developer, I've had the opportunity to work on a variety of projects that have allowed me to showcase my skills and creativity. Here's a list of some of my proudest accomplishments:</p>

            <ul>
                <li>Website Development: I developed a website for <a href="https://lvpsg.org/" target="_blank">LVPSG</a>, which showcases my ability to design and build a functional website from scratch.</li>
                
                <li>Temporary File Cleaner: I wrote a "Temporary File Cleaner" for Windows, which helps users free up space on their computers by removing unnecessary temporary files.</li>
                
                <li>School Timetable Scraper: I wrote a Python program that scrapes my school timetable and copies it to Google Calendar. This helps me stay organized and get notifications before class.</li>
                
                <li>Discord Bot: I wrote a Discord bot in Python, which can be used to automate tasks and add interactive features to Discord servers.</li>
                
                <li>API Development: I developed an API for <a href="https://api.theflyingrat.com" target="_blank">theflyingrat.com</a> with Node, which allows users to access data and functionality from my website and projects in a more convenient and flexible way.</li>
                
                <li>Send2Self (still in alpha stages): I'm currently working on a project called Send2Self, which is still in the alpha stages. This project is a platform for sending small files between devices without the need of a centralized server, and I'm excited to see where it goes in the future!</li>
            
                <li>QuickSecureQR: A Python app that converts a password into a QR code that is only visible for 5 seconds before disappearing. This solved a niche issue where I had a really long password that needed to be copied into my phone. QSQR solves this by making it extremely convenient to copy passwords into my phone.</li>
            </ul>
            
            <p>These projects have allowed me to apply my knowledge and experience in a practical and meaningful way, and I'm always looking for new challenges to tackle.</p>
