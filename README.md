# Website for `joeymanani.com`

### Who

Website for myself, by myself, about myself

### What

A portfolio showcasing my achievements, work and what I do for a living

### When

This will go live soon. I have been working on this for a week, and have been thinking of writing a portfolio for myself for a long time - and I'm glad I did

### Where

On `joeymanani.com`. My current "personal" website non-related to work can be found at `theflyingrat.com`.

### Why

Maybe it will assist me in finding employment in the future. For the last 2 years, I've always wanted a place to publish my work and achievements, so why not a website? Especially since development is my job and I find it fun.
